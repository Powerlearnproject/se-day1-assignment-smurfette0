List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
 design - building the framework. 
 coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**An integrated development environment (IDE)** is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

**Version Control Systems (VCS)** - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and optimizing input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, ensuring accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. It involves structuring prompts in a way that guides the modelâ€™s behavior, improves output consistency, and minimizes ambiguity.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in Interacting with AI Models
Enhances Output Quality

Well-structured prompts lead to more accurate, contextually relevant, and coherent responses from AI models.
Poorly designed prompts may result in vague, incorrect, or irrelevant answers.
Improves Efficiency and Productivity

Effective prompt engineering reduces the need for excessive iterations and refinements, saving time and effort.
Helps users get the desired response on the first attempt.
Enables Task-Specific Customization

Different tasks (e.g., summarization, code generation, content creation) require tailored prompts.
Well-crafted prompts can make AI models more useful for various applications, from chatbots to software development.
Reduces Bias and Misinterpretation

Properly phrased prompts can minimize model bias by providing clear instructions.
Ensures responses align with ethical guidelines and factual accuracy.
Optimizes AI Model Performance

Fine-tuned prompts can help AI models generate structured outputs, such as lists, tables, or specific formatting styles.
Helps in generating creative and problem-solving responses tailored to user needs.
Facilitates Better Human-AI Collaboration

A well-designed prompt ensures smoother communication between users and AI, leading to more natural and meaningful interactions.
Allows AI to function effectively in applications such as customer service, education, research, and automation.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt
"Tell me about technology."

Issues with the Vague Prompt:
Too broad: "Technology" is a vast topic covering multiple domains such as AI, software, hardware, medical technology, etc.
Lacks context: It does not specify what aspect of technology the user is interested in (history, impact, future trends, etc.).
Unclear intent: The prompt does not indicate whether the user wants a summary, analysis, examples, or a detailed explanation.
Improved Prompt
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, focusing on patient diagnosis and treatment improvements."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective?
âœ… Specific Topic: Narrows the focus to artificial intelligence in healthcare rather than all of technology.
âœ… Clear Context: Specifies the areas of impactâ€”patient diagnosis and treatment.
âœ… Defined Intent: Clearly requests an explanation of AI's effects, ensuring the response is relevant and informative.

By refining prompts in this way, users can obtain more precise, useful, and actionable responses from AI models.
